  <h2>Project mazerob</h2>

  <p>Project mazerob is a robot that autonomously solves a maze.  The
  system runs on Java Virtual Machines on a personal computer and a Lego
  NXT Brick configured as a master-slave architecture.  Project mazerob
  was partially funded by <a href="http://www.uanl.mx">UANL</a> through
  the <a
    href="http://www.uanl.mx/universidad/investigacion/apoyos/provericyt.html">PROVERICYT</a>.</p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>

  <p>The slave is a wheeled vehicle with a rotating ultrasonic range scanner,
  built with a Lego Mindstorms NXT kit, running software in package {@link
  mazerob.nxt}.  The master is the PC running software in package {@link
  mazerob.pc}; it drives the NXT/slave to solve the maze.  Package {@link
  mazerob.conn} helps with the communication link between the PC/master and
  NXT/slave through a Bluetooth connection.</p>

  <p>{@link mazerob.pc.PC} is the main application entry, it parses
  command line positional arguments to configure the NXT.  Executing a
  {@link mazerob.pc.Robot} method specified by the {@link
  mazerob.conn.RemotelyControllable} interface invokes the corresponding
  {@link mazerob.nxt.Robot} method.  The link between the instances
  methods is implemented over a Bluetooth connection, mapped by
  constants specified by {@link mazerob.conn.CommandCode}.</p>
